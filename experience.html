<li><p>Project Leader, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9834132/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Physics-Constrained Vulnerability Assessment of Deep Reinforcement Learning-based SCOPF</a>, Zhejiang University, 06/2020 - 12/2021
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It proposes a physics-constrained vulnerability assessment framework for a DRL-based power system operation and control model in the SCOPF 	problem by considering a more realistic case that adversarial examples are stealthy (i.e., bypass the BDD mechanism) only when the manipulated observations follow the power system physical constraints.

<li><p>Project Leader, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261922009850" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Resilience enhancement of multi-agent reinforcement learning-based demand response against adversarial attacks</a>, Zhejiang University, 12/2021 - 06/2022

</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It develops a novel robust adversarial training framework, RAMARL, which can mathematically formulate the adversarial Markov Game and improves the MARL models&rsquo; performance by robust adversarial training. Specifically, RAMARL models the adversarial attacks as an optimal adversary agent considering the perturbation bound and designs periodic robust adversarial training.

</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It comprehensively investigates adversarial attacks and defense mechanisms for DRL-based power system emergency control. It designs recovery-targeted (RT) adversarial attacks which are gradient-based approaches, and the corresponding robust defense (RD) mechanisms, which actively modify the observations based on the distances of sequential states.
