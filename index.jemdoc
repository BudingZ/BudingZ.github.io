== About me
I am currently a third-year PhD student affiliated with [http://nesc.zju.edu.cn/ NESC Group] at [https://www.zju.edu.cn/ Zhejiang University (ZJU)]. I am fortunately advised by [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/mingyang.sun11 Prof. Mingyang Sun]. I also received the B.S. degree  in electrical engineering and automation from [https://www.xmu.edu.cn/ Xiamen University (XMU)] in 2020. 

My research interests include reinforcement learning in power systems operation and control. Recently, I am working on exploring vulnerabilities of deep reinforcement learning-based power systems and enhance robustness against cyber-attacks.

== Research Interests

Security of Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Energy System Operation and Control

- Vulnerability Assessment
- Robust Enhancement
